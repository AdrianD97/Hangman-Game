			# Hangman-Game

		I have implemented a clasic hangman game. This is a version of classic game of hangman where you try to guess the word before the man dies.
		To play you press the letters on the keyboard to try and reveal the word. If the word contains the pressed letter then it is revealed, but if 
	the word doesn't contains the letter then a part of the hangman picture is drawn. When the picture is completely drawn the game is over.

		The game was implemented in C++. I have used SFML library.
		I have used as IDE CodeBlocks.
